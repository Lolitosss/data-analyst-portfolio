# Welcome to Lolita's Data Analysis Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Lolita, a data analyst passionate about uncovering hidden patterns and turning data into actionable insights. I believe in the ability of data to reveal hidden stories within lines and rows, turning abstract information into concrete understanding.

### About me

While my career began in front-end engineering. I've always been drawn to the power of data. My recent experience in the healthcare industry, working with SQL databases for a year, solidified this passion and provided practical skills in data management and querying.

To further deepen my knowledge, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis tools and techniques.
